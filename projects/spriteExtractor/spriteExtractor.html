        <h1>Introducing Text2Game: Revolutionizing Game Development with AI-Driven Dynamic Assets</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Welcome to the future of game development! Today, we are excited to introduce <strong>Text2Game</strong>, an innovative engine that transforms text-based inputs into engaging and interactive game worlds. Powered by the latest advancements in AI, including DALL-E 3 for image generation and our custom SpriteExtractor for sprite extraction, Text2Game makes it easier than ever to create dynamic game assets on-the-fly.</p>
        
        <h2>What is a Text2Game Engine?</h2>
        <p>A Text2Game engine is a game development platform that uses natural language inputs to generate game content. Imagine describing a scene or a character in simple text, and having the engine instantly create the corresponding pixel art, animations, and interactive elements. This approach opens up endless possibilities for game developers, allowing for more creativity, faster prototyping, and richer player experiences.</p>

            <h2>Demonstration</h2>
            <p>Let's dive into an example to see Text2Game in action. We'll demonstrate how a simple user input can generate a dynamic game scene.</p>
            
            <h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Generating World Seed</h4>
            <p>Click the button below to generate a random world seed:</p>
            <button id="generateSeedButton">Generate World Seed</button>
            <div id="worldSeedDisplay"></div>
            
            <h4>2. Generating Sprite Sheet</h4>
            <p>Choose how you want to generate the sprite sheet:</p>
            <button id="localUploadButton">Upload from Local Filesystem</button>
            <button id="dalle3Button">Generate from DALL-E 3</button>
            <img id="generatedImage" src="" alt="Generated Sprite Sheet">
            
            <h4>3. Sprite Extraction</h4>
            <p>The generated image is processed by our SpriteExtractor to isolate the individual sprites, which can then be used in the game.</p>
